                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Inspiring the Future connects children and young people in
                  Years 3 to 8 with volunteers and role models from the world of
                  work through a fun and inspiring activity.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Volunteers talk about the jobs they do, the pathway they took
                  to get there, the skills they developed, and the challenges
                  faced along the way.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  These activities meet the aims of the New Zealand Curriculum
                  and Te Marautanga o Aotearoa for all New Zealand children to
                  build their sense of self, and realise their potential.

              <div><h4>What Happens at Inspiring The Future Activities?</h4><ActivityText><p>Inspiring the Future activities follow four standard steps.<br/><br/>
<strong>‚Ä®1.	Setup</strong><br/>
Schools select four to six volunteers through the Voluntarily platform to participate in an Inspiring the Future activity, run during school hours. Schools can select volunteers with specific skills or jobs.
<br/><br/>
<strong>2. Twenty questions game</strong><br/>
‚Ä¢	Volunteers sit on stage or at the front of the classroom, wearing everyday clothes.
‚Ä¢	The students try to guess what each volunteer‚Äôs job is by asking them questions, which should be answered with only ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù.
‚Ä¢	Volunteers leave the stage.
<br/><br/>
<strong>3. The reveal</strong><br/>
One by one the volunteers return, wearing their work clothing or holding a prop that symbolises their job. They each talk briefly about:<br/>
‚Ä¢	who they are<br/>
‚Ä¢	their role<br/>
‚Ä¢	the pathway they took to get to their role<br/>
‚Ä¢	skills they developed and challenges they faced along the way.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>4. Student-led questions</strong><br/>
Once all the volunteers have revealed their jobs, the children break into small groups to ask questions and learn more about the skills, experience and background of each volunteer.<br/>
